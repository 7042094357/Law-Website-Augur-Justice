   <b>1. Commissioner Of Central Excise vs Mangalam Cement Ltd. on 30 May, 2007 :-</b><br><p>These two appeals are filed by the Revenue against the common order made by the
Commissioner (Appeals) by which he set aside the orders-in-original
confirming service tax demand in one case(Service Tax Appeal No. 2/23 of 2005) of Rs.
60,26,508/- under Section 73(2) of the Finance Act, 1994, imposing penalty of Rs. 48,700/-
under Section 76 and ordering interest amount of Rs. 8,84,287/- under Section 75 of the
Finance Act, 1994, and in the other case (Service Tax Appeal No. 224 of 2005)
confirming service tax of Rs. 24,23,911/- under Section 73(2) of the Finance said Act, imposing
penalty of Rs. 48,700/- under Section 76 of the Act and ordering payment of interest of Rs.
3,83,608/- under Section 75 of the Act.<br>
The learned authorized representative for the respondents-assessees in his elaborate and
lengthy arguments argued that the ratio of the decision of Hon&#39;ble the Supreme Court in Gujarat
Ambuja Cement Ltd. (supra) was inapplicable in the present case because in that group of writ
petitions including that of respondents-assessees, the challenge against the constitutionality of
the provisions of Sections 116 and 117 of the Finance Act, 2000 was in issue. He submitted that
merely because the constitutionality validating of the provisions was upheld, it cannot be
inferred that the service taxcould be recovered from the respondents-assessees on the basis of
the liability arising by virtue of the validating provisions which were upheld by the Supreme
Court. He submitted that Section 71A did not deal with tax liability and that the payment
of service tax was required to be made under Rule 6 of the said Rules, which was applicable
to cases where periodic returns were to be filed.</p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hNPC49TplwIxwFTQm7ju96PzXc7iBWGz/view?usp=sharing" style="color: black"><b>Read More...</b></a>

     <b>3. MMT VS MAHARAJA REGENCY :-</b><br><p>In the present case, both Petitioners have been regularly filing service tax returns and have
been paying service tax. It is the admitted case of the Respondents themselves. None of the
Petitioners fall under the category of a person not filing a return under Section 70 of the FA as
envisaged under Section 72 (a) of the FA. Under Section 72 (b) of the FA, the return filed by the
Assessee can be scrutinized by the Central Excise Officer who has been assigned his functions
in terms of the provisions of the FA read with CE Act.<br>
 Section 73A (1) requires any person liable to pay service tax who has ―collected any amount
in excess of the service tax assessed or determined and paid on any taxable service under the
provisions of this Chapter or the rules made thereunder from the recipient of taxable service in
any manner as representing service tax&quot; to forthwith pay the amount so collected to the credit of
the Central Government. The crucial words are ―collected any amount in excess of
the service tax assessed or determined.‖ The other expression which has significance is: ―in
any manner as representing servicetax.‖ The case of the DGCEI is that service tax is being
collected by the Petitioners from the recipient of taxable service ―in any manner as
representing service tax‖.
