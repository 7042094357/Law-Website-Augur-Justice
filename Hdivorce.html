   <b>1. Balvir Singh Vs Harjeet Kaur :-</b><br><p>The core issue of debate in the present appeal from order, preferred by the husband is the adjudication
made by the court below by the judgment dated 28.09.2015 in the Suit no. 77 of 2013, whereby while
deciding issue no. 2, the Court has held that the Bar of Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure will not
come into play, when the Bar is being sought to be attracted on the basis of the proceeding under
Section 9 vis-à-vis proceeding under Section 13-A of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. 2. The appellant on
26.02.2013 had filed a petition under Section 13-A of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, seeking dissolution of
the marriage, which was said to have been solemnized between the plaintiff and the defendant on
15.06.1984. Although not relevant, but still it could be said that the grounds for dissolution of marriage
as pleaded, was mental cruelty, misbehavior, physical assaults and the solemnization of second marriage
with another female namely Paramjit Kaur. In the said suit the pleadings were exchanged. On the
exchange of the pleadings, one of the issues which cropped up and was framed as to whether the suit in
question would be barred by 2 Section 11 of Code of Civil Procedure in view of the fact that the
proceedings under Section 9 stood decided. 3. For the scrutiny of the aforesaid issue, reference to
section 11 as contained in the Code of Civil Procedure is necessary and is quoted herein below for
convenience:- 11. Res judicata. – No Court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and
substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same
parties</p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j9GoTteDGQdq39Hvo9WCNVw2fJFOpchF/view?usp=sharing" style="color: black"><b>Read More...</b></a>

     <b>2. Dinesh Singh Thakur Vs Sonal Thakur :-</b><br><p>Dinesh Singh Thakur v/s Sonal Thakur 
<br>
Dinesh Singh Thakur, the appellant, and Sonal Thakur, the respondent had married on 20.02.1995 according to Hindu Rites. At the time, when the marriage took place, the appellant was working in the United States of America (USA) and after the marriage was solemnized he also took his wife, the respondent to USA on Dependent Visa. Two children were born out of the said wedlock. Later, both the parties got the citizenship of USA and further obtained PIO status (Person of Indian Origin) in 2003 and OCI status (Overseas Citizen of India) in 2006.
In 2016, the appellant filed a petition against the respondent under Sections 13 and 26 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Subsequently, the respondent-wife filed a case for divorce in the Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit in and for Pinellas County, Florida, USA, on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage and other reliefs.
Thereafter, a civil suit was filed by the appellant-husband before the District Judge at Family Court, Gurgaon, under Section 7 of the Hindu Marriage Act for a permanent injunction and declaration inter alia to restrain the respondent-wife from pursuing the petition for divorce before the Court in USA. Learned District Judge, vide order dated 26.09.2016, granted an ex parte ad interim injunction to the appellant-husband. Later, the Learned District Judge vacated the injunction granted after the respondent, being aggrieved, filed an application for the vacation and modification of the order. The appellant then appealed before the High Court where his petition was dismissed.
Aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, the appellant filed an appeal by way of special leave in the Supreme Court.
ISSUE BEFORE THE COURT OF LAW
The only point for consideration before the court was whether the appellant husband was entitled to the decree of anti-suit injunction against the respondent-wife?

     <b>4. Raj Talreja Vs. Kavita Talreja :-</b><br><p>Introduction: Mental Cruelty is a ground for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act along with other grounds such as adultery, desertion, conversion, entering new religion, unsoundness of mind, etc. Prior to 1976 amendment, cruelty was not a ground to divorce in India. Cruelty is not defined in the Hindu Marriage Act. Cruelty can be of both physical cruelty and mental cruelty. Mere trivial quarrels between the spouse do not amount to cruelty. In the case of Naveen Kohli v Neelu Kohli, of the year 2004, the Supreme Court has held that ‘Cruelty’ is a consistent course of conduct inflicting immeasurable mental agony and torture.<br>
Facts: – The Parties involved in the appeal got married in 1989 according to Hindu Rites. The Husband and the Wife lived with the parents of the husband until the year 1999 and in the year 1999, the couple shifted to their own residence. On 19.03.2000, the husband left the matrimonial home and thereafter, on 25.03. 2000, he filed a petition for grant of a decree of divorce. Subsequently, on 07.11.2000, certain news items appeared in the Newspapers in which serious allegations were made against the husband which were published on the intimation given by the wife. On 04.12.2000, the wife filed a complaint to the State Women Commission making serious allegations against the Husband. Thereafter, she also sent similar letters to the Chief Justice of the High Court and the Superintendent of Police and a complaint was made to the Chief Minister. On 16.03.2001, the complaints were found to be false.

     <b>5. Nagalingam Vs. Shivagami  :-</b><br><p>This appeal is directed against the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Madras in Criminal Appeal No. 486 of 1999 reversing the order of acquittal passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate, Madras. The learned Single Judge found the appellant guilty of the offence under Section 494 1PC.<br>
The appellant, S. Nagalingam married respondent-complainant Sivagami on 6.9.1970. Three children were born from that wedlock. The respondent alleged that the appellant started ill-treating her and on many occasions she was physically tortured. As a result of ill-treatment and severe torture inflicted by the appellant as well as his mother, she left her marital home and started staying with her parents. While so, the respondent came to know that the appellant had entered into a marriage with another woman on 18.6.1984, by name Kasturi.
The Metropolitan Magistrate held that an important ceremony, namely, “Saptapadi” had not been performed and therefore, the second marriage was not a valid marriage and no offence was committed by the appellant. The learned Single Judge reversing this decision in appeal held that the parties are governed by Section 7-A of the Hindu Marriage Act as the parties are Hindus residing within the State of Tamil Nadu. It was held that there was a valid second marriage and the appellant was guilty of the offence of bigamy
Issue: Whether the second marriage entered into by appellant with the second accused. Kasturi, on 18.6.1984 was a valid marriage under Hindu Law so as to constitute an offence under Section 494 IPC.

     <b>8. SUSHMITA GHOSH VS G.C. GHOSH :-</b><br><p>Smt. Sushmita Ghosh, who is the wife of Shri G.C. Ghosh (Mohd. Karim Ghazi) filed a Writ Petition in this Court stating that she was married to Shri G.C. Ghosh in accordance with the Hindu rites on 10th May, 1984 and since then both of them were happily living at Delhi.<br>
Around the 1st of April, 1992, Shri G.C. Ghosh told the petitioner that she should in her own interest agree to her divorce by mutual consent as he had any way taken to Islam so that he may remarry and in fact he had already fixed to marry one Miss Vanita Gupta resident of D-152 Preet Vihar, Delhi, a divorcee with two children in the second week of July 1992. Shri G.C. Ghosh also showed a Certificate issued by office of the Maulana Qari Mohammad Idris, Shahi Qazi dated 17th June, 1992 certifying that he had embraced Islam.<br>
The petitioner contacted her father and aunt and told them about her husband’s conversion and intention to remarry. They all tried to convince Shri G.C. Ghosh and talk him out of the marriage but of no avail and he insisted that Sushmita must agree to her divorce otherwise she will have to put up with second wife.<br>
It was stated in the petition that Shri G. C. Ghosh has converted to Islam solely for the purpose of re-marrying and has no real faith in Islam. He does not practice the Muslim rites as prescribed nor has he changed his name or religion and other official documents.<br>
She ultimately prayed for the following reliefs:
