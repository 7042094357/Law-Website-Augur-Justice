   <b>1. A.A. Balasundaram Vs. A. Vijayakumari and anr :-</b><br><p>Judgment:
ORDER <br>
1. The revision petition filed by the husband is directed against an order awarding maintenance of Rs. 150/- per month to the wife, whereas the criminal petition challenges the order confirming the finding of the Courts below that the marriage between the parties is a valid one. 
<br>2. The wife filed a petition alleging that the marriage between herself and the revision petitioner took place on 7-2-1987 at Rajahmundry in a temple as per Hindu rites and that due to estrangement of relations, she was forced to be away from the husband and live with her parents. It is in her evidence, as P.W. 1, during the course of cross-examination, that she was a Christian by birth, whereas the husband was a Hindu. The trial Court found the marriage between the parties to be valid, but refused to grant maintenance on the ground that the husband has no source of income. When the matter was taken in revision, the Court below awarded a maintenance of Rs. 150/- per month to the wife upholding the finding regarding the validity of the marriage. Hence, the revision petition and the criminal petition by the husband. 
<br>3. In view of the admission that the wife was a Christian by birth, whereas the husband was a Hindu and the marriage between them took place as per Hindu rites, the question that arises for consideration is whether the marriage is a valid one for purposes of granting maintenance under section 125, Cr.P.C. </p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x-O5ZyYJ78W0acE8JVjKxTbNnkDeyNLq/view?usp=sharing" style="color: black"><b>Read More...</b></a>

<br>1. This is an appeal under Section 55^~DIVORCE ACT, 1869~^ of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 (shortly hereinafter referred to as the 'Act') filed by the husband against the judgment dated 6.3.1997 passed by the 4th Additional District Judge, Jabalpur, whereby his petition under Section 22^~DIVORCE ACT, 1869~^ of the Act for grant of decree of Judicial Separation has been dismissed.

     <b>3. Gnanasoundari Vs. Nallathambi Alias Jokiam Jebamalai and ors. :-</b><br><p>Judgment:
ORDER <br>
Happell, J. 
<br>1. This is a petition to revise the judgment of the Special First Glass Magistrate, Devakottai, in Calendar Case No. 76 of 1944, by which he has acquitted the first and third accused in that case. The 1st accused was baptised a Roman Catholic and married his first wife in a Roman Catholic Church. The complainant P.W. 1 is a protestant and in 1930, after the death of his first wife, the 1st accused married her in a Protestant Church, the ceremony being performed by a Protestant Pastor. Two children were born of the marriage. On 19th May, 1942, the complainant executed a release deed Ex. 1, in favour of the 1st accused--the relevance of this deed will appear later. On 16th September, 1943, the 1st accused married the 2nd accused in a Roman Catholic Church, the ceremony being performed by the 3rd accused, a Roman Catholic Priest. Thereafter on 14th December, 1943, P.W. 1 filed a complaint in the Court of the Joint Magistrate of Ramnad charging the 1st and 2nd accused with the offence of bigamy punishable under Section 494 of the Penal Code, and the 3rd accused with abetment of the offence. 
<br>2. Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code reads: 
Whoever, having a husband or wife living, marries in any case in which such marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the life of such husband or wife, shall be punished, etc. 
<br>3. The marriage between the 1st accused and the complainant in 1930 was a marriage solemnised under the provisions of the Indian Christian Marriage Act (Act XV of 1872). Section 1 of that Act states that the Act ' extends to the whole of British India ' and Section 4 provides that:

     <b>4. Maria Soosai Vs. Clara Mary :-</b><br><p>Judgment:
Srinivasan. J. <br>
1. This case raises an interesting question of law. The original petition is one filed under Section 4 of the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, by the husband for a decree declaring that the alleged marriage between him and the respondent is null and void and consequently, the respondent is not his legally wedded wife. In the petition, it is stated that he was having intimacy with the respondent for a few months and in order to compel him to marry her, the respondent's parents and relatives, with the help of the Police, by force got executed a deed of marriage on paper bearing Rs. <br>2.50 stamp on the 27th October, 1988 and got it registered in the Office of the Sub Registrar, Andimadam. According to the provisions of the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, a Christian marriage can be solemnized only in any of the modes prescribed in Section 5 of the said Act. No formality or ceremony was gone through and only an agreement was executed as stated earlier and that too, under compulsion. The registration of the document would not amount to registration of the marriage and therefore, the marriage is null and void. 
<br>2. The respondent remained ex parte and the petitioner gave evidence in support of the allegation made in the petition. He has marked the agreement as Ex. A-1. A perusal of Ex. A-1 shows that there was no marriage in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Christian Marriage Act. The agreement by itself cannot be about a valid marriage. 
<br>3. The District Judge has accepted the evidence adduced by the petitioner and held that the petitioner was entitled to the relief prayed for by him. But instead of passing a decree for declaring the marriage to be void, the District Judge, ordered that the marriage said to have been performed between the petitioner and the respondent was dissolved. It was also added by the District Judge that the decree is subject to confirmation by this Court under Section 20 of the Indian Divorce Act.

     <b>6. Mrs. Chandramani Dubey and anr. Vs. Rama Shankar Dubey and ors. :-</b><br><p>Judgment:
Kidwai, J.<br>
1. Dr. H. S. Dubey, formerly Medical Officer of Health at Lucknow, died on 31-10-1942. He was Brahman and had married a Brahman wife from whom he had two sons, the plaintiffs, Rama Shankar and Karuna Shankar, and two daughters, Shanti Devi and Kanti Shukla. Dr. Dubey's Brahman wife died in 1927 and, it is no longer disputed, he went through the ceremony of marriage under the Indian Christian Marriage Act (XV [15] of 1872) with Mrs. Chandramani Dubey, a Christian by religion. A son, Udai Shankar and a daughter, Kamni, were born of this union.
<br>2. For some time after Dr. Dubey's death there were no disputes between the parties and, in two litigations, Mrs. Chandramani Dubey and the six children were all impleaded as his legal representatives without any objection by any of them. Later, however, relations became strained and, on 25-4-1944, the two plaintiffs, denying the factum of the marriage and alleging that, in any case, it was legally void and ineffectual, instituted the suit out of which this appeal arises for a declaration that they are the sole heirs of Dr. Dubey, and as such, the sole owners of the property mentioned in Lists A and B attached to the plaint. They also alleged that the property in the two lists which stood in the name of Mrs. Dubey was in fact acquired by Dr. Dubey and Mrs. Dubey was-only a benamidar.
<br>3. Mrs. Chandramani Dubey and her children under guardianship were impleaded as defendants 1 to 3. Shanti Devi and Kanti Devi were defendants 4 and 5. They never appeared and the suit proceeded ex parte against them. Mrs. Chandramani Dubey, however, contested the suit on behalf of herself and of her two minor children. Subsequently Kamni died and she is no party to this appeal. In the written statement it is pleaded :

     <b>7. Mrs. Pragati Varghese and Etc. Vs. Cyril George Varghese and Etc. :-</b><br><p>Judgment:
ORDER <br>
Agarwal, J. <br>
1. Present suits arc filed by Christian wives for dissolution of their marriages under Section 10 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 (hereinafter referred as 'the Act'). Each of them impugn the vires of the provisions of Section 10 of the Act which provides for the grounds on which a husband and wife can sue for dissolution of marriage. It is contended that the provisions are archaic and adversely discriminate wives as against husbands merely on ground of sex and are, therefore, violative of article 15 of the Constitution. It is further contended that theaforesaid provisions adversely discriminate them vis-a-vis wives belonging to other communities. They are, therefore, denied equality before law and hence the provisions are violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. It is also contended that the aforesaid provisions force them to continue to live with their husbands as wives even though they are subjected to cruelty or desertion. They are, therefore, deprived of their right to life and personal liberty thereby violating their dignity. The provisions, therefore, contravene Article 21 of the Constitution.
<br>2. Plaintiffs have also impugned certain ancillary provisions of the Act namely Sections 17 and 20 of the Act which provide for a requirement of confirmation of decrees for dissolution of marriage or nullity of marriage, passed by District Judges, by the High Court and that too normally by a Bench of not less than three Judges.
<br>3. Present suits were filed on the original side of this Court and came up for hearing before the learned single Judge Mrs K. K. Baam, J. When the aforesaid challenges was raised before her, by an order passed on 20th of December, 1996, she has referred the suits to a larger Bench under Rule 28 of the High Court. Original Side Rules, 1980. The learned Chief Justice has, thereafter, referred the suits to the present Full Bench for deciding the aforesaid issues raised in these suits.

Manjunath, J. <br>
1. The legality and correctness of the decree of divorce granted by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Bangalore dt.8.6.2012 passed in M.C.No.3578/2011 is called in question in this appeal.<br>

     <b>9. Reynold Rajamani and anr. Vs. Union of India (Uoi) and anr. :-</b><br><p>Judgment:
R.S. Pathak, J. <br>
1.The appellants, who belong to the Roman Catholic community, were married on December 30, 1967 in Podannur in the State of Tamil Nadu under Section 27 of the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872. On July 26, 1979 they put in a joint petition under Section 28 of the Special Marriage Act for a decree of divorce by mutual consent in the Court of the learned District Judge, Delhi. On March 11, 1980 the trial court dismissed the petition oil the ground that Section 28 of the Special Marriage Act could not be availed of. The appellants filed a writ petition in the High Court of Delhi which having been dismissed they proceeded in appeal to this Court. In the appeal they applied for permission to amend the joint petition to enable them to rely upon Section 7 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 read with Section 1(2)(d) of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1973 of England. The amendment was allowed and the appellants filed an amended joint petition in the trial court seeking divorce on the ground that they had been living separately for more than two years and had not been able to live together and their marriage had broken down irretrievably and therefore they were entitled to a decree of divorce under the aforesaid provisions. On August 16, 1980 the trial court dismissed the petition holding that the appellants were not entitled to rely on Section 1 (2) (d) of the English statute. The appellants took the matter to the High Court of Delhi and the High Court has affirmed the view taken by the trial court. 
<br>2. In this appeal Miss Lily Thomas, appearing for the appellants, contends that the trial court and the High Court are wrong and that in reading Section 7 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 the provisions of Section 1 (2) (d) of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1973 must be deemed to be incorporated therein and therefore the appellants are entitled to the benefit of the ground for divorce set forth in the latter enactment. In deference to Miss Thomas's vehement submissions and having regard to the importance of the question we heard her at length but we indicated that the point raised by her did not carry conviction and we reserved judgment in order to give a fully reasoned order. Shortly thereafter, Miss Thomas's put in an application asserting that she had information that the Government of India was proposing to amend the matrimonial law in relation to the Christian community in India and praying that in the circumstances judgment may not be delivered for sometime. There has, however, been no change in the law since and it is appropriate, we think, that judgment should be pronounced now without further delay.
