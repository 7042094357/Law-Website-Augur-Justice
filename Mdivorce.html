   <b>1.Smt.Khatiza Tul Qubra and Tara Bano vs Iqbal Mohd :-</b><br><p>On the basis of evidence, the learned trial Court deciding the said issue in favour of the 
defendant - wife dismissed the suit of the plaintiff- husband. However, the first appeal 
filed by the plaintiff - husband before the appellate Court was allowed and the suit was 
decreed by the first appellate Court vide impugned judgment dtd.6.9.2007 and the learned
first appellate Court found that since the respondent did not obtain any decree from the 
Civil Court for dissolution of marriage under Section 2 of the Dissolution of Muslim 
Marriage Act, 1939, therefore, her first marriage with the plaintiff was valid as per 
Section 272 of the Muslim Law Sheriyat and thus, the first appellate Court found that the
defendant could not prove repudiation of her marriage with the plaintiff and thus decreed
the suit. <br>

     <b>3. Mohd. Ahmed Khan vs Shah Bano Begum :-</b><br><p>One of the most landmark cases in the history of India, pertaining to Muslim
women, was the Shah Bano Case of 1985. This case introduced an ever
standing conflict between what should and should not come under the
adjudication of the Supreme Court of India.<br>
Facts of the case<br>
 Shah Bano Begum, a Muslim woman, was divorced by her husband, Mohd.
Ahmed Khan, by virtue of the Triple Talaq system. The issue that came up, was
that Ms Bano had claimed maintenance under the Code of Criminal Procedure,
rather than as per the personal laws.<br>
 The personal laws of Islam state that a woman may be given maintenance for the
‘iddat’ period, i.e., a period of three menstrual cycles, along with the ‘mehr’, i.e., the
money promised to the bride, at the time of marriage.

     <b>5. Mr Ali Abbas Darauwala Vs Mrs Shehnaz Daruwala  :-</b><br><p>2. The petitioner and the respondent belong to Islamic Alvi Bohra Community and were 
married on 16.10.1997. Out of the said marriage three children were born and one eldest 
son expired on 28.10.2014. The other two children are aged 14 and 13 years respectively. 
The respondent-wife filed petition for divorce under the Dissolution 
   of  Muslim <br>
  
 Marriage  Act, 1939 seeking dissolution of the marriage, before the Family Court at 
Bandra on 15.04.2015 and invoked provisions of Section 2(viii)(a)(d) of the Dissolution 
of Muslim Marriage Act, 1939 and also prayed for custody of the children, maintenance 
and accommodation. The said prayer for divorce was opposed by the petitioner by filing 
written statement. <br>
5. She would also make reference to Section-2 of The Dissolution of Muslim Marriage 
Act, 1939 and would submit that the said Act permits a women to obtain a decree for 
dissolution of marriage on the grounds set out in the said section. The learned counsel 
for the petitioner would thus submit that the Family Court has erred is not considering the
fact that divorce sought under the Act for all practical purposes is by way of "Khula" and 
that is a reason there is no provision for any other reliefs for maintenance, custody of 
children etc., provided in the Act.

     <b>8. Chand Patel vs Bismillah Begum & Anr on 14 March, 2008 :-</b><br><p>The respondent No.1 herein, Bismillah Begum, filed an application for her maintenance and for the maintenance of her minor daughter, Taheman Bano, under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, against one Chand Patel, in the Court of the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Chincholi, being Criminal Misc. No.6 of 2001. In her petition she claimed that she was the legally wedded wife of the appellant herein and that her marriage with the appellant had taken place about eight years prior to the filing of the said petition. Her further case was that the marriage was consummated and two years after the marriage a daughter was born from the wedlock and she has been made petitioner No.2 in the application for maintenance. The petitioner No.2 Taheman Bano being a minor, is under the care and guardianship of her mother, the petitioner No.1, in the said application.<br>
6. In her petition the respondent No.1 herein categorically admitted that the appellant herein was married to her elder sister, Mashaq Bee, and that the appellant, with the consent of his first wife married the respondent No.1 and a Nikahnama was also executed but the same had been misplaced. It was also admitted that the appellant herein lived with his first wife Mashaq Bee and the respondent No.1 under one roof and the appellant had even accepted the petitioner No.2 as his daughter and had brought her up.<br>
7. That with the passage of time the relationship between the appellant and the respondent No.1 began to deteriorate and he started neglecting the respondents who have no means to support themselves. The respondent No.1 prayed for maintenance for herself and for her minor daughter @ Rs.1,000/-

     <b>9. Ashraf Vs Jennathu Beevi :-</b><br><p>Learned counsel for the revision petitioner canvassing the correctness of the order passed 
by the learned Magistrate painstakingly highlighted the fact that the divorced wife had 
obtained divorce under the provisions of the Dissolution 
   of  Muslim 
     Marriage  Act, 1939 
and the main thrust of the argument is that as the dissolution of marriage was brought 
about by the wife under the dissolution of Muslim 
     Marriage  Act, 1939, the decree under
the said Act did not amount to divorce by the husband, because marriage was dissolved 
by operation of law. Learned counsel submitted that a divorced wife is entitled to claim 
from her former husband reasonable and fair provision for future livelihood under 
Section 3 of the Act only if the divorce proceeded from her erstwhile husband and the 
divorced wife is not entitled to claim fair and reasonable provision unless the divorce is 
given by the former husband unilaterally or is obtained by her from him. Learned counsel
also questioned the sustainability of the order passed by the learned Magistrate on the 
ground that the learned Magistrate had not taken into consideration while awarding Rs. 
60,000/- towards reasonable and fair provision the needs of the divorced woman, the 
standard of life enjoyed by her during the subsistence of the marriage and the means of 
her former husband.
