   <b>1. Bankey Vs Allahabad :-</b><br><p>Chunni was resident of Mauza Basoma, District Budaun. On 06-11-1957, which was a day previous to Puranmashi, Chunni along with his son Jai Lal went to Asafpur railway station on his way to Chaubari for taking a dip in the Ganges. He left the ladies and children at the house. Since the train was to leave in the night, they had gone a little earlier and they were sleeping at the railway station. It is alleged that the accused- Bankey taking the opportunity of the absence of the adult male members of the family entered the house at about 10 O’clock in the night, caught hold of Smt. Tufania, wife of Jai Lal who was sleeping alone in the Kothri and forcibly wanted to remove her dhoti and to have sexual intercourse with her. Bankey was held liable and convicted under section 376 read with section 511 of Indian Penal Code.<br>
Arguments of the appellant:<br>
•	There had been a dispute about the mend of a field between appellant and Chunni; and Chunni had threatened to implicate the accused in some false case and therefore he has been implicated.<br>
•	The ingredients of Section 509 were not put to the appellant when he was being examined under Section 342, CrPC.
Arguments of the respondent:<br>
•	The respondent-prosecution has produced five witnesses in order to prove their case. All these witnesses had confirmed that the accused entered into the house to satisfy his immoral motives
Ratio:<br>
•	The appellant was not able to produce any evidence of the fact that there had been any dispute about the mend. He has not been able to show when the dispute took place. If it had taken place only a short time before the incident that may have been a reason for false implication, but if it had taken place long ago that would be no ground for falsely implicating.<br>
•	From the evidence of the prosecution witnesses there does not appear to be any doubt that Bankey had entered the house of Chunni with some immoral motive. But the bench did not think that he had gone to the extent of actually committing rape. He appears to have been making only gestures and uttering sounds, and intruding upon her privacy by removing her petticoat or sari in order probably to persuade Smt. Toofania to agree to his immoral desire, on which her mother-in-law and the neighbours got up. Under such circumstance, he will be liable under section 509 read with section 511 of Indian Penal Code.</p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ngdME_9mAbeA6aX1W88AF87xYhPHVTGE/view?usp=sharing" style="color: black"><b>Read More...</b></a>

     <b>2. Nirbhaya Rape Case :-</b><br><p>The 2012 Delhi gang rape case involved a rape and fatal assault that occurred on 16 December 2012 in Munirka, a neighbourhood in South Delhi. The incident took place when a 23-year-old female physiotherapy intern, Jyoti Singh Pandey. was beaten, gang raped, and tortured in a private bus in which she was traveling with her friend, Awindra Pratap Pandey. There were six others in the bus, including the driver, all of whom raped the woman and beat her friend. Eleven days after the assault, she was transferred to a hospital in Singapore for emergency treatment but died from her injuries two days later. The incident generated widespread national and international coverage and was widely condemned, both in India and abroad. Subsequently, public protests against the state and central governments for failing to provide adequate security for women took place in New Delhi, where thousands of protesters clashed with security forces. Similar protests took place in major cities throughout the country. Since Indian law does not allow the press to publish a rape victim's name, the victim has become widely known as Nirbhaya, meaning "fearless", and her life and death have come to symbolise women's struggle to end the rape culture in India and the long-held practice of either denial of its existence within the country,] or otherwise blaming the victim rather than the perpetrator.<br>
All the accused were arrested and charged with sexual assault and murder. One of the accused, Ram Singh, died in police custody from possible suicide on 11 March 2013 in the Tihar Jail.

     <b>3. Vishakha and Others vs. State of Rajasthan (1997) :-</b><br><p>Before the Vishakha Guidelines came in, the workplace was dangerous for many
women especially in case of sexual harassment. In 1992, Bhanwari Devi was gang-
raped by upper caste men in her village because she tried to raise her voice against
child-marriage. Due to gross negligence, the vaginal swabs collected from her body
were taken 48 hours after the incident. Ideally, it should be done so within 24 hours.
Shockingly, the judge presiding over her case (this was the seventh judge after six
others were removed) acquitted the accused, even going so far to say, &quot; Since the
offenders were upper-caste men and included a brahmin, the rape could not have
taken place because Bhanwari was from a lower caste. &quot; Following the outrage over
this acquittal, Vishakha and some other women&#39;s groups filed a PIL against the State
of Rajasthan and the Union of India, forcing the latter to adopt the Vishakha
Guidelines which now protects working women all over the country.<br>
Women experiencing sexual harassment at workplace had to lodge a complaint under Section 354
of the Indian Penal Code that deals with the &#39;criminal assault of women to outrage women&#39;s modesty&#39;
and Section 509 that punishes an individual or individuals for using a &#39;word, gesture or act intended
to insult the modesty of a woman&#39;.
